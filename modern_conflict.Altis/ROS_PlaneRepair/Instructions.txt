ROS Plane repair v1.5 - by RickOShay

Supports all planes in Arma 3 / DLCs / RHS / SOG
Plane must have hitpoints - most CUP planes are therefore not supported.
Works with ROS Heli Repair.

LEGAL STUFF
Credit must be given in your mission and on the Steam Workshop if this script is used in any mission or
derivative works. There are three dependent scripts: ROS_PlaneRepair.sqf, ROS_WelderPlane.sqf, ROSWavein.sqf.
They must be kept together.

USAGE:
Recommended - copy the demo hangar including the props and units and helipad etc. (Hangar requires SOG CDLC) into your mission or save as Composition - note you will need the ROS_PlaneRepair folder and CfgSounds entries in description.ext as well.

If not using the hangar - in the editor drop down a square helipad where the plane will be repaired.
You must use the large square pad - and make sure its direction points to the wavein unit (see ROS_waveinplane script header).
Likewise make sure the wavein unit points to the center of the helipad. The wavein unit must be at least 30m directly behind the the helipad.
Place a Repair AI unit 30m behind the helipad (from helipad center) facing the helipad in the direction of incoming planes
and ~3m to the LHS of the wavein unit.
Repair unit must be in his own group and be a minimum of 30m from the helipad.

Place the following line in the Repair units init field:
[this] execvm "ROS_PlaneRepair\scripts\ROS_PlaneRepair.sqf";

Copy the ROS_PlaneRepair folder to your mission root.
Add the sound classes from the provided description.ext to Cfg_Sound in your description.ext.

For added effect use the ROS_wavein.sqf script to have a unit wave in the taxiing plane.
See that included script's header for instructions.
