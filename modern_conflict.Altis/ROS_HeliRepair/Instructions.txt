ROS_Helicopter_Repair v1.5 by RickOShay

This script allows you to add a fully functional helicopter repair bay to your missions.

LEGAL STUFF
Credit must be given in your mission and on the Steam Workshop if this script is used in any mission or derivative works. 
There are three dependent scripts: ROS_HeliRepair.sqf, ROS_Welder.sqf, ROSWavein.sqf.
They must be kept together under the ROS_HeliRepair folder.

FEATURES
* A 'wave in' unit will auto wave in helicopters that need fuel or repair. It will track the incoming helo and wave lights sticks for easier navigation.
* Once landed an AI repair unit will walk over to your helo (after you have switched off the engine) and proceed to repair the vehicle.
* If it's night an orange rotating repair light will appear on the helipad to signal in use.
* The repairer will use a welding animation complete with welder cart and sparks.
* Once vehicle repaired a fuel hose from a spawned in fuel truck will appear and connect to the helo.
* The helo will be refueled.
* Once refueled the repair unit will announce the vehicle is repaired and refueled and proceed to return to the origianl position.   
* Custom sound effects for repair and refuel and landing clearance
* If repair bay has debris like a destroyed heli - it will be removed
* AI pilots can no longer use the repair bay (too unreliable)
* Works in SP and on hosted (listen) and dedicated servers

HOW TO USE THIS SCRIPT 
See demo for reference.

In the editor drop down a helipad where the heli will land and be repaired. Suggest a large square pad - its easier to see and for large helos to position themselves. Place a Repair AI unit ~20m behind the helipad (from helipad center) facing the helipad in the direction of incoming helos.
Repair unit must be in his own group and be a minimum of 20m from the helipad.

Place the following line in the Repair units init field:
[this] execvm "ROS_HeliRepair\scripts\ROS_HeliRepair.sqf";

For added effect use the ROS_wavein.sqf script to have a unit wave in the helis. Simply place a suitably attired unit 20m in front of the helipad.  
See the ROS_wavein.sqf script's header for more instructions. 

Copy the ROS_HeliRepair folder into your mission folder.

Add the CfgSound sound classes to your description.ext see example description.ext file.
